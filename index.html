		Hello! I'm a Software Engineer and a Machine Learning ethusiast. I recently completed a Ethereum payment service
		project as a co-founder, lead researcher and developer. Prior to this, I was a CPA, CA who specialized in Data
		Analytics and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) process for banks.
	</p>
	<p>
		I graduated from University of Waterloo with a Bachelor in Mathematics, and continued a career in FP&A as
		a CPA. My love for math and programming slowly pushed me towards a career in Data Analytics. Eventually, I
		worked my way to complete my Master degree in Computer Science from University of Illinois, specializing in
		Machine Learning and Data Analytics. I am on my way to pursue my passion in Computer Science.
	</p>
	<p>
		When I am not working, you can find me exploring a variety of Computer Science related topics. I find all CS
		subjects very interesting.
